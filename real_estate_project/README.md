# 🏠 Real Estate Investment Advisor

A machine learning–based application that helps evaluate real estate properties by:
- Predicting whether a property is a **Good Investment**
- Estimating the **Property Price after 5 Years**

This project demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a Streamlit web app.
