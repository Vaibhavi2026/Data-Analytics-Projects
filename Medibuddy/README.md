# MediBuddy Insurance Data Analysis & Cost Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes MediBuddy insurance customer data to identify key factors influencing insurance claims and to predict insurance costs using machine learning.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to answer business questions
- Identify key risk factors affecting insurance charges
- Build and optimize a machine learning model for cost prediction

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression (Baseline)
- Random Forest Regression (Optimized using GridSearchCV)

## Key Insights
- Smoking status has the highest impact on insurance charges
- BMI, age, region, and dependents significantly influence costs
- Gender has minimal impact on insurance pricing

## Outcome
The optimized Random Forest model achieved better accuracy with lower error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to Linear Regression.
